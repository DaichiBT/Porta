      <p>
        I’ve been passionate about game development since 8th grade. Inspired by other talented developers, I became fascinated with how games are created. I taught myself game development over the years, working on countless projects, and eventually began leading my own initiatives assembling and managing a team to bring my creative visions to life.

Their flagship game, Anime Fighting Simulator, with over 1.3B visits. Currently, the group is working on Anime Legends, an MMORPG with over 1.7M views on its official YouTube trailer.
